/**
 * Generators are one-sided Enactors that do not take In any Widget. 
 * It only couples with an Out Widget to manipulate it through the subscription mechanism.
 * This class should be overridden to make use of the {@link #updateOutWidget(context.arch.widget.Widget.WidgetData)}
 * method to manipulate the Out Widget.
 * 
 * Though not strictly the best approach, but convenient, Generator subclasses Enactor because it shares many similarities, but has some differences.
 * Similarities: both
 * - Have Out Widgets
 * - Subscribe to their widgets
 * - Can manipulate widgets through the subscription mechanism
 * Differences: Generator
 * - Doesn't have In Widgets, and so no subscription query for that
 * - Uses the logical query item to specifically match with an Out Widget of interest (more specific than just the classname)
 *   - Whereas Enactors should typically apply the logical query on an In Widget
 * - Once it matches the Out Widget of interest, it gets its subscription details
 *   - and doesn't need to listen for queries anymore
 * - Can use an external process to set the outcomeValue, 
 *   - and should also set the value of the Out Widget
 * 
 * The main purpose of subclassing Enactors is to be able to have a subscription handle on the Out Widget.
